Hello everyone! This is going to be my first post here, just trying things out.

I'm not planning on writing much today, so don't get too excited.

I would like to link a few sites that helped me set this blog up in the first place.
First, I forked [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) to create this site with Github Pages.
It was very easy to setup, so thanks to everyone who's worked on that.

Also, I felt like it would be nice to have some sort of tagging mechanism to make it easier to group posts into different categories.
After some quick googling, I found [this site](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/)
that I ended up using as a reference, for which I am very grateful.

I still have more work to do on the general style of the site.
After that, I plan to start writing posts somewhat regularly, maybe a couple times a month.

For now, expect to see some posts coming soon about [Go](https://golang.org), [Python](https://python.org), and the Domain Name System (DNS)!
