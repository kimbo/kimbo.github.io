title: A blog is born

Welcome to my blog. Let me give a quick introduction.
I'm not planning on writing much today, so don't get too excited.

If you're interested in making your own blog and you like the look of this one,
I forked [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) to get up and running with Github Pages.
It was super easy to setup, so thanks to everyone who's worked on that.

<s>Also, I felt like it would be nice to have some sort of tagging mechanism to make it easier to group posts into different categories.
After some quick googling, I found [this site](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/)
that I ended up using as a reference.</s>I remove tagging, seemed kinda bloaty, especially for how often I post.

I may add some more styling to the blog as it goes on, and I haven't decided about comments yet.

For now, expect to see some posts coming soon about [Go](https://golang.org), [Python](https://python.org), and the Domain Name System (DNS).
I'm also planning on posting about open source project ideas that I think of or hear about.

Stay tuned!
