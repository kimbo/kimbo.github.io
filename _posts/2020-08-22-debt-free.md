title: How I Graduated College Debt-Free

TL;DR: Get good grades, and get a job. If you don't get good grades, get another job :wink:

I chose the first one.
My high school GPA coupled with my high ACT score got me a half-tuition scholarship at BYU.

Hold on, I skipped an important step. I went to BYU. Their tuition for full tithe-paying members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is ridiculously low.
We're talking $3/3.5K per semester, so less than 7 thousand bucks a year for full-time students.
So before you get excited about grades, it helps to go to a university with low tuition costs.
BYU is constantly ranked as one of the best value higher education institutions, so keep that in mind when you're looking at colleges.

Anyway, so the first 3 semesters at BYU I got a half tuition academic scholarship based on my high school GPA/ACT.
The last 4 semesters of my undergrad I got full tuition academic scholarship based on my GPA at BYU.
So basically I got good enough grades at BYU to make the cut-off for full tuition.

I must say, half tuition was alright, but full tuition was awesome.

Another factor to consider is the difficulty (and length) of your major.
My major - Spanish translation - is pretty easy when compared to other majors like mechanical engineering or exercise science.
It also only had 37 required credit hours, which means I finished rather quickly while still having space in my class schedule to pursue other interests (e.g. a minor in computer science, which is what I did).

Just realized I haven't mentioned getting a job yet. Probably should do that now...

I got a job at Jiffy Lube right when I moved up to Provo to go to BYU.
I worked there for about a year and a half.
It was good to learn a few things about car maintenance and customer service.
But it was also good because I needed to pay the rent, foot the grocery bill, and come up with the other half of the tuition, which was about 3K a year.

I left Jiffy Lube to go work in the laundry at the Provo City Center Temple.
It was awesome. I got really good at folding pants, socks, slips, nylons, and more.

After six months, I got a job working on the content for language learning software through a friend of a friend.
A few months went by and I finagled my way into a computer programming job working on the language learning software.

I'll stop there, since the point of this is that I always had a job, I was always working.
I never stopped working so I could concentrate solely on my school work.
Working was a necessity if I wanted to continue going to school and living in my apartment and eating my food, and so on.

So there you have it.

1. Get good grades (and ACT score) in high school
2. Get good grades in college
  - Note that if you do well enough at number 1, you don't have to worry as much about number 2.
3. Choose an easy major if you can. Otherwise, don't.
4. Get a job and work it as much as you need to make things work.

There's my not-so-expert advice, but it's the best I've got.
